# superhero-backend

## Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (>= 14.x.x)
- **npm** (Node package manager) or **yarn** (if preferred)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using `git`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:hamzafaqhi/SuperHeroApi.git
cd SuperHeroApi.
```

### Installing
```
> npm install or yarn install  (this will install all dependent libraries)

> npm run dev  (This will start the server with live reloading using nodemon)

> npm run start  (This will run the project with the compiled JavaScript code)

> npm run build  (This will create the build of JavaScript code)

> npm run test  (o run the tests, you can use the following command)
```
### Team Player Attitude
```
In collaborating with a teammate, I would ensure that we divide tasks clearly, focusing on the areas where each of us can bring the most value. For example, one person can focus on improving the logic in the superHeroService, while the other can refine the socket communication or validation logic. Collaboration would involve regularly reviewing each other's code, providing constructive feedback, and ensuring that any decisions we make align with the overall architecture and goals of the project.
```

### Eagerness to Learn
```
If I had more time:
Superhero Service Refactor: I would focus on improving the superhero service layer, possibly introducing a database (like MongoDB) instead of using an in-memory array. This would allow for better persistence, data querying, and scalability.
Socket Enhancements: Further exploration into the real-time communication aspect could be interesting. For example, I would implement additional events for updating or deleting superheroes, ensuring the frontend gets real-time updates on changes.
Unit Testing: I would implement unit tests for the controller and service layers to ensure that the logic is working correctly and can easily be modified or extended without breaking existing functionality.
